## ProcessingPipeline

ACME company is using ProcessingPipeline to process their reservations posted from their website. Task consits of sending emails, charging credit cards, generating tickets, etc. 

ProcessingPipeline is implemented as a chain of responsibility / middleware pattern. Class `PipelineBuilder` based on posted data sets up the pipeline for current invocation. `ReservationPipelineExecutor` is class responsible for executing generated pipeline.

### Architecture and considered alternatives
Whole pipeline is executed synchronously from http standpoint which could be potential bottleneck however this approach was selected to fit size and load of ACME corporation which deals with hundreds and sometimes thousands of reservations per day. This could be further improved with publish-subscribe messaging - offloading some of the work to different services and scaling it independently. 

### Testing
Each step is unit tested. Services like SendEmail, NotifySlack, GenerateEmail don't have interfaces, instead I'm providing HttpClient with test messageHandler which contains canned data. That way Iâ€™m testing everything up to http boundary. 

Underlaying database is MongoDb and it's better to use actual mongo instance for unit tests, rather than faking `IMongoQueriable<T>`, because it's not guaranteed fakes would act same as actual MongoDB. Because of that I'm running instance of mongo with random database name for unit tests inside docker. That way its 100% tested it will work on environment with real database.
